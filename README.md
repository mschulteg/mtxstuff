# mtxstuff
A tool to manage the subtitle and audio track flags of mkv files by using mkvpropedit.
This package is currently UNDOCUMENTED and WORK IN PROGRESS.
It is possible that it will never be finished.

Editing can be done using CLI args or using the TUI.
The TUI is probably the more stable feature.

```bash
# TUI
mtxstuff tui /dir/with/mkvfiles
```
