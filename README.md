# mtxstuff
A tool to manage the subtitle and audio track flags of mkv files by using mkvpropedit.

This program is just an undocumented prototype and not ready for use.

Editing can be done using CLI args or using the TUI.
The TUI is probably the more stable feature, to open it use:

```bash
# TUI
mtxstuff tui /dir/with/mkvfiles
```
