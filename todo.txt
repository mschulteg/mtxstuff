OLD:
- Command methods should not return a vector of arguments??

NEW:
- Quit correctly without artifacts
- Refresh changed files (automatically or via button)
- Make Frame<CrosstermBackend<Stdout>> generic for popup trait
- Add option to run the commands
- Also Gray out top and bottom bar when in background?
- Use more spans, then we can also use Spans.width() and remove the explicit unicode-width dep.
- Say when mkvtoolnix is not found
- Support multiple track selections and edits in CLI mode
- Make TrackOperations generic over TrackType
- Fix undefined in CLI - see row()
