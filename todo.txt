OLD:
- Command methods should not return a vector of arguments??
- builder pattern for command (but it always has to run on the same file)

NEW:
- Quit correctly without artifacts
- Refresh changed files (automatically or via button)
- Make Frame<CrosstermBackend<Stdout>> generic for popup trait
- Add option to run the commands
- Handle "unset" for track name and lang (distinguish between unset and "")
- Also Gray out top and bottom bar when in background?
- Use more spans, then we can also use Spans.width() and remove the explicit unicode-width dep.
- CLI --group x --track y without any command should just list the track and not call mtxpropedit
- Say when mkvtoolnix is not found
- Command should contain a file list instead of a file or no files at all (only passed to the execute function)
